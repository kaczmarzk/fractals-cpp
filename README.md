### Sierpinski Carpet and Koch Snowflake

**Fractals**

The term "fractal" comes from the Latin word meaning "broken" or "fragmented." The most important characteristic of fractals is self-similarityâ€”they are objects that can be infinitely complex and composed of identical structures. This means that any small piece of a fractal, when appropriately magnified, resembles the entire set or a part of it. Fractals have a simple description and are often generated by repeating the same operation multiple times.

**Sierpinski Carpet**

The Sierpinski Carpet is a fractal obtained by dividing a square into nine (3x3) smaller squares, removing the central square, and recursively applying the same procedure to each of the remaining eight squares. Its area equals zero.

**Koch Snowflake**

The Koch Snowflake is created by drawing three Koch Curves in such a way that they together form a single figure. The Koch Snowflake can be constructed iteratively through a sequence of stages. The first stage is an equilateral triangle, and each subsequent stage is formed by adding outward bends on each side of the previous stage, creating smaller equilateral triangles. The areas enclosed by successive stages of the snowflake converge to 8/5 times the area of the original triangle, while the perimeters of the stages increase without bound. Consequently, the Koch Snowflake encloses a finite area but has an infinite perimeter.

**OpenGL**

OpenGL can be defined as a "**software interface to graphics hardware**." It is a library designed for creating three-dimensional graphics, known for being very fast and easily portable across different systems. OpenGL is used for various purposes, from CAD programs and architectural applications to generating computer-animated dinosaurs in the latest films. OpenGL is a procedural library, meaning that instead of describing a scene and its appearance directly, the programmer describes the steps necessary to achieve a specific look or effect. It does not include functions for window management, user interaction, or input/output operations.
